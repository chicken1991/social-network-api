  ## Description
  This is a backend API utilizing NoSQL - MongoDB and Mongoose - as a node/express server. It showcases an API that can be tested through Insomia to execute CRUD operations with Mongoose. The exercise involves a social media type implementation, tracking users, thoughts (posts) and reactions (reactions to the thoughts). These can all be added, deleted, modified, and viewed with standard CRUD operations.
